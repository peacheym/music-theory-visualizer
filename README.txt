# Visualization Project Readme

This document provides an overview of my CSCI6406 project, including instructions for how to run and interact with the visualization dashboard.

## How to run visualization project

Extract all of the files in this .zip folder to your web-server's root directory. For MAMP, this would be htdocs, but may be different if you are using different software.

There is textual information at the top of the page. There should then be three visualizations, one piano stacked upon two other visualizations that are placed side by side.

Depending on your laptop or monitor's resolution, you may need to adjust your browser's zoom to 90% (or lower) in order to see the visualizations as they were intended to be displayed.
