# Assignment 1

## System requirements

As consulted with the TA, this assignment requires a specific resolution of browser screen to display the visualizations properly. In order to view this assignment correctly, please ensure your browser window has the following dimensions.

- Width: 1663px
- Height: 1394px

This will ensure that all of the D3 elements are positioned properly relative to both the background image and eachother.

## How to run

The following instructions demonstrate how to run this project.

Unzip the entire project to your `htdocs` folder (for MAMP, use approptiate folder for other local webserver softwares).

Next, navigate to `<insert link>` to view the finished project.

## Interactivity

I have programmed several interactive components to fulfil the final 20% component of this assignment. A list of how each of these can be used by a user is as follows:

- Chart 1: When a user clicks on the date, they are able to toggle between data for 2021 and 2022.
- Chart 3
- Chart 4: When the user hovers over each of the paths, it will animate the progression of the path.
- Chart 5
- Chart 6

## Citations

I used several references to the d3 documentation while learning about how it worked for this assignment. While the work included as submission for this assignment is my own, some code aspects of it were inspired directly from this documentation. A set of links to specific pages of documentation I refered to is included below, along with the code snippets which utilized that information.
